Android studio requires the following componenst to run offline:

   ***  android-studio-ide......linux.tar.gz    ---> will download necessary SDK tools as well

   ***  Android Gradle Plugin    ---> this is to be able to run gradle locally on host

   ***  Google Maven dependencies  ---> this is to store dependancies locally



   see screenshots for setup.



!!!NOTE : as of 06.09.2020, after installation of latest android_studio-4.0.1, the build with offline components is impossible, since android-studio requires Android Gradle Plugin of version 4.0.1 of higher but as offline component only AGP(andorid gradle plugin) of version 3.5-beta could be downloaded.

As a temporal option we can download previos version of Android Studio, and set up it with offline components.
